    "bio": "From the moment I produced 'Hello World' in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been 'just a job' for me, it's offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple 'Hello World' has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by. Below you'll find projects I've completed that showcase my skills and general background in developing software.",
